## User scenario

## User Interface Design Principles

1. You are able to book a hairdressers appointment, make this your #1 priority to make this clear for your user. Be kinda predictable, but ignore conventions.

4. Keep status and let users be in control of their flow. Give feedback on what will happen next.

6. Give the user one input action. Like setting a date or choosing what kind of appointment.

9. Items should look how they behave. **! Beware of conventions**. 

11. /
12.  What is the most important step in your application? : Setting date, time and appointment info. Break it down to the essentials to defer cognitive load. 

14. Divide actions into different steps. Like booking an appointment at the hair dresser.

16. Give the user information about certain aspects/ features the user can do. Give them the possibility to turn this feature off (e.g. finder)
