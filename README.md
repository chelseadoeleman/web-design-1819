## Features

## User scenario

Marijn (age) works as a developer. But has a handicap called being physically motor impaired which causes tremors and muscle rigidity. He works always with a macbook pro and uses sticky keys to help him navigate the keyboard. He is can only navigate the keyboard with his left hand. Especially fine motor skills are a difficulty for Marijn, so lifting his hand takes up a lot of energy. Because all his muscles are affected he sometimes has trouble with speech which doesnâ€™t make him always comprehendible.

In two days Marijn has a wedding he has to attend to, naturally he would like to look his best. To achieve this chique look he would like to have his hair done differently before the wedding. 
The best day to do this is on the day of the big event, because then it would look its best. Luckily Marijns hairdresser has the option to book an appointment online. Because Marijn is at work he wants to do this quickly so he can resume his daily tasks. Marijn can only use his left hand and still not at its full extent because he suffers from tremors and muscle rigidity. 

When opening the website Marijn is able to navigate the site quite easily with his left hand, even when pressing a wrong key. Because he wants to change something he has done before he uses a key as a sticky key to navigate backwards. The interface is clear because it has been broken down into steps. In the end Marijn is able to fix any mistakes he made in the earlier steps. When he gets interrupted during work he is still able to resume his task where he left off. Luckily the hair salon has one place left on that specific day in the morning with Marijns favorite hairdresser. Marijn has booked an appointment successfully and can now go back to work.

## User Interface Design Principles

1. You are able to book a hairdressers appointment, make this your #1 priority to make this clear for your user. Be kinda predictable, but ignore conventions.

4. Keep status and let users be in control of their flow. Give feedback on what will happen next.

6. Give the user one input action. Like setting a date or choosing what kind of appointment.

9. Items should look how they behave. **! Beware of conventions**. 

11. /
12.  What is the most important step in your application? : Setting date, time and appointment info. Break it down to the essentials to defer cognitive load. 

14. Divide actions into different steps. Like booking an appointment at the hair dresser.

16. Give the user information about certain aspects/ features the user can do. Give them the possibility to turn this feature off (e.g. finder)
